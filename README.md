I'm Sakshi — a developer passionate about software engineering, problem-solving, and building things that make an impact.

I’m currently focusing on data structures & algorithms, problem-solving, and AI-assisted development and Machine Learning. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, creating meaningful projects, and strengthening my engineering fundamentals.

I'm fascinated by large-scale systems, high-impact products, and how AI is transforming modern development. My long-term goal is to contribute to real-world applications and impactful features used at scale.

Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, learning new things, exploring science, and staying curious.
